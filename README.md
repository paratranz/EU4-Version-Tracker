# EU4-Version-Tracker
Track EU4 file diff from version to version

## Files
This project **ONLY** tracks files related to **localisation**.

## Version
Current version is placed in `version.txt`.

## Diff
The `diff` directory contains all changed files to last version, 
if there's no `diff` directory, then there's no changed files to last version.
(Sometimes will happen)

## How to use
If you want to see the previous version diff, go to `commits` page through the link below the description, 
it'll show all the previous commits. 
You can view diff to last version or repository files at some point there.
